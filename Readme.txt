ZenseMe (Windows Phone, Zune, MTP device scrobbler for Last.fm)
By Arnold Vink (Dumbie)
Release: v1.1.6

--------------------------------------------------------

| Installation Instructions
1) Extract the ZenseMe directory to any directory you want.
2) Make sure that you installed the requirements (.NET Framework 4.5 / Visual C++)
3) Launch ZenseMe.exe, set your Last.fm username and password in the settings.
4) Fetch the songs from your device by clicking on "fetchsongs"
5) Have fun scrobbling songs from your mobile devices.

| Update Instructions
When you are updating ZenseMe from a previous version make sure you "DON'T" delete the "Data" directory,
This directory contains a database with all your previous made scrobbles, skipped and ignored tracks.

| Tips and tricks
- When the songs don't show up on your Last.fm profile make sure ZenseMe is not blocked by your firewall.
- By right clicking on the "Recently Played/Ignored Tracks" list you can select all tracks, artists, albums or devices.
- Your device only saves the playcount from stored tracks, tracks streamed with your Zune Pass or Google Music will not count.
-(?) You can check if your device is compatible with ZenseMe in this list: http://www.last.fm/group/ZenseMe/forum/245330/_/1015674
-(?) If all the songs show up with a playcount of 0 it means your device does not support playcount information or is set to MSC mode.
